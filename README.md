# Lymphoma Classification using Data Augmentation - Deep Learning Project
In this study, we address the common challenge in medical image classification posed by limited dataset sizes, particularly in the context of Lymphoma images. Our project
aimed to develop and evaluate new data augmentation techniques to enhance the performance of neural network classifiers. We introduced three novel algorithms that apply distinct
transformations to the images, thereby increasing the dataset size and diversity. These transformations involved modifying image properties and introducing structured noise, enhancing
the datasetsâ€™ overall quality. Our experimental results demonstrate that these new augmentation techniques improve classification accuracy, showcasing their potential in overcoming
the limitations of small medical image datasets and advancing the field of medical image analysis.

## Instructions
